My first ever attempt to code! 07/25/2021
Hello, my name is Michael Dyer.  I recently graduated highschool but I will not be attending college.  I have a very unique view on life, I disagree with nearly the entire US schooling system.  But I will be successful! I am here to learn and grow after I work my 9-5 every day.  I am an entrepreneur, and will find success within my own personal growth!
